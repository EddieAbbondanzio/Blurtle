# Updog.in

Updog is a reddit-esque content aggregation website. Users can create accounts to share posts, and create comments. Posts can be upvoted and downvoted and users can earn karma on their posts.

This project was built as a learning experience to see what it would take to build a reddit clone. The front end is built using Vue.js and TypeScript. The back end is powered by ASP.NET Core, and a PostgreSQL database. Architecture wise the project adheres to clean architecture although I've never actually read the book so it probably isn't 100% up to par ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
